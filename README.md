# Project 1- Web Application

### Requirements for this assignment:
Clone this repository to your computer.
Develop a web application that retrieves data from a web service, parses and filters the data and displays useful information in an intuitive and accessible interface. The application must include:
- At least two web pages
- Navigation between pages
- Data retrieved from a web service
- Well formatted pages
- Useful data display (charts are recommended but not required)
- User interaction (buttons or other user input)

You may use any web service that you like, but be aware that some require OAUTH authentication which can be difficult to implement.  Here are some sample web services to get you started:

- http://openweathermap.org
- http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api
- http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2#examples
- http://search.digitalgov.gov/developer/jobs.html
- http://www.data.gov
- https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/index.html (note that you will have to host these data sets - you can use the CaMS server)

When you've completed the project, commit and push your solution to GitHub. Be sure that you have moved to the repository directory using `cd directory-name` before you issue these commands.
```
git add .
git commit -m "completed project 1"
git push
```
